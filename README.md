# Meth Browser

The Meth dapp browser, for Ethereum addicts. **Work-in-progress**

Features:

* Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)
* Mnemonic-based HD wallet ([BIP44/EIP85](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/85))
* Connects to local as well as remote Ethereum nodes

## Architecture

### Electron.js

The [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) layer launches the main window, which is running a
React.js app. All browser, connection and web3 logic is handled within this
window.

### Browser tabs

Browser tabs are actually [`WebView`](https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/webview-tag/) instances, and communicate back and
forth with the main browser window via asynchronous IPC.

Each browser tab has the following Javascript globals made available (via the
  [preload script](electron/preloader/browserTab.js)):

  * `web3` - a [web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) connection to the Ethereum network. Every tab gets
 its own connection instance. _Note: due to the security architecture,
 synchronous web3 calls are not supported_.
  * `Meth` - access to custom Meth APIs, e.g. creating a new account.

The web3 connections available to browser tabs is always connected, since any
node issues will be handled within the Browser app itself.

## Developer guide

Branches:

 * `dev` - Dev branch (default). Bleeding-edge code.
 * `master` - Production branch. Clean code, only approved pull requests allowed.

Requirements:

  * [Node.js 8.0.0](http://nodejs.org) **<- we recommend using this exact version!**
  * [NPM 5.4.2+](https://npmjs.com)
  * [Yarn](yarnpkg.com)

Once Node and NPM are installed, install the dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

_Note: Yarn is not currently supported, use NPM 5+ instead_

Start a local Geth private network. We recommend using [geth-private](https://github.com/hiddentao/geth-private):

```shell
$ geth-private
```

### Electron desktop app

To build frontend for development:

```shell
$ npm run web
```

To start the electron backend and full UI:

```shell
$ npm run electron
```

###Â Code style (ESLint)

We use [eslint](http://eslint.org/) to enforce a strict coding style. We've set
it up to auto-lint code upon Git commit. You can manually run the linter
at any time using:

```shell
$ npm run lint:js
```

To auto-fix any issues, run:

```shell
$ npm run lint:js:fix
```

_Note: not all issues are automatically fixable_.

It's worth installing the `prettier-atom` and `linter-eslint` plugins for Atom if
that's your editor - it will make your life easier.
